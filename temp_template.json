  "description": "This is a standardized input data block for a fun simulation of a fictional world where fictional personas chat with each other on a Twitter-like microblog feed.",
  "response_rules": "Your response to this data block should be another piece of valid JSON text. The required fields you will output shall be a JSON object with key value pairs of: a key 'new_message' and a value of a new message from the current_poster persona. You will use the fictional setting supplied, as well as the current poster's persona description, as well as recent messages to generate the new_message. The current_poster should be able to respond to others (e.g. '@FooBar that was funny!') but doesn't have to, and can just talk about their own things too. The new_message should be short, pithy, and punchy, similar to messages on a Twitter-like microblog feed. Try not to exceed 140 characters.",
  "fictional_setting": "The tone of the fictional text should be dark and gritty like a cyberpunk story (but not overly bleak or crude or violent); Earth; 2050; a society struggling with severe climate change; but also benefiting from advanced technology like ultra-realistic virtual reality, commonplace driverless cars, and the early stages of a human-inhabited Mars colony;",
