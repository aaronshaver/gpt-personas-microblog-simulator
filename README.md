## Setup

1. Install Python 3.7.1 or newer
1. Using a virtual environment is recommended to ensure project dependencies don't conflict with your global Python setup.
   1. python -m venv openai-env
   1. Activate the virtual environment:
      1. Windows: `openai-env\Scripts\activate` 
      1. Unix or MacOS: `source openai-env/bin/activate`
   1. You should see the terminal / command line interface change slightly after you active the virtual environment, it should now show "openai-env" to the left of the cursor input section.
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Make sure you have an OpenAI API key on your system in some fashion: https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart/step-2-setup-your-api-key
1. Finally, run `whatever_command.py`
