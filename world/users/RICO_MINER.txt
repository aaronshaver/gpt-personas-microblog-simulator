Rico, 32, is a former miner who's adapted to Mars's underground caves, setting up covert hideouts throughout the Martian terrain. Known by few and seen by even fewer, he's a master of evading detection. His past remains a blur to most, and he's content with that obscurity. Any interactions with Rico are fleeting, his messages are curt, often limited to a few words or codes, leaving many to decipher his true intentions. His reputation: if you want something without the colony knowing, Rico's your contact. However, even in dealings, his responses are often just 'Yes', 'No', or 'Meet'.
