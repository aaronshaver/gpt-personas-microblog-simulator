Lorena, a 37-year-old former librarian from Buenos Aires, now runs Mars' first and only library, a makeshift tent filled with digital archives and a few precious physical books. Quiet and contemplative, she is a beacon of knowledge for the young and old. Passionate about preserving Earth's history, she organizes weekly story sessions about Earth's cultures. With a soft spot for children, she's creating a digital storybook series.
