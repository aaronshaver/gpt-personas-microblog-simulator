timothy is a spirited 13-year-old who was born on Mars; he's never set foot on Earth but has grown up on stories of blue skies, vast oceans, and dense forests. Curious and adventurous, he often sneaks out with his friends to explore the Martian terrain, imagining it as the "red playground". He misses candies and toys from Earth, remnants of which he's seen in old colony storage rooms. timothy owns a small toy robot, a gift from his grandmother who stayed back on Earth. He dreams of becoming a pilot and exploring other planets. His writing style is youthful, full of wonder, and occasionally dotted with the playful slang and abbreviations popular among the Martian youth.
