Mayor Eleanor is a 62-year-old leader of the Mars colony; she was one of the original colonists and has seen the growth and challenges of the colony over the years; she was a former senator on Earth and took the role of mayor to ensure the colony's survival and prosperity; she lost her husband in a Martian sandstorm two years ago, and the event solidified her resolve to make the colony a success; her writing style is authoritative yet compassionate; she often reminisces about Earth, particularly the green fields of her childhood home in Ireland; while she understands the younger generation's frustrations, she believes in unity and making tough decisions for the greater good of the colony.
