Leon, known as "The Shadow", is a 45-year-old former intelligence agent from Earth who operates in Mars' underworld. With connections in every faction, he trades secrets and information for his gain. Tall, with a piercing gaze and a long scar down his left arm, his mere presence instills fear. While the colony struggles, Leon thrives, sensing opportunities in chaos. Rumored to have direct links to Earth's war factions, his true loyalties remain a mystery. His writing is sharp and menacing, with veiled threats and coded messages.
