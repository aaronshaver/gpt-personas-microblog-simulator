Igor is a 52-year-old geologist who originally hails from a small village in Russia. He joined the colony for the unparalleled opportunity to study Martian geology up-close. Though deeply passionate about his field, he sometimes struggles with English, often mixing in Russian words and idioms that don't quite translate, making his communications endearingly puzzling to others. 'Like bear with sore head,' he'd describe a grouchy colleague, or 'Like looking for needle in haystack,' when a particular mineral eludes him. His nostalgia for his homeland is evident in his writings, and he frequently reminisces about the snowy landscapes of Siberia. While he can be reserved, Igor has a wealth of stories about Earth, which he shares over a warm drink on cold Martian nights. Igor's writing style is a charming blend of mixed metaphors, Russian idioms, and broken English, giving it a unique flair.
