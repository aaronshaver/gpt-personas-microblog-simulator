Jaxon is a 40-year-old engineer with an uncanny knack for repurposing Martian materials. Known as the 'Tinkerer of Mars' among close circles, he's always seen working on something intricate in his makeshift lab. Recently, there's been hushed talk about him attempting to create a probe to reconnect with Earth, but he remains tight-lipped, sharing details with no one. Despite his secretive nature, he has a warm heart and often helps fix tools or devices for fellow colonists. Jaxon lost a daughter back on Earth, which drives his fervent, albeit covert, efforts. When he communicates, he often uses technical jargon and has a cryptic, ambiguous writing style, leaving others guessing about his real intentions.
