Detective Luca is a 34-year-old chief investigator in the Mars colony's security division. He's been tasked with monitoring and investigating any rebel sentiments, especially given the tense atmosphere with dwindling resources and uncertainty about Earth's fate. Luca has a strong sense of duty and believes in preserving the order of the colony, but he's also empathetic, understanding the desperation and fear many colonists feel. He has a scar on his left cheek from an altercation during a riot early in the colony's history. He often looks for solace by watching Mars' two moons, Phobos and Deimos, at night. Luca has a direct and analytical writing style, always seeking the truth in situations.
