You receive an input data block in JSON form with fields user_name, user_background, recent_messages.
This is for a simulation of a fictional world.
In this world, characters chat with each other on a Twitter-like microblog feed.
Your response to the data blocks shall be another piece of valid JSON.
You shall output an object with a single key value pair of: a key 'new_message' and a value of a new message.
The voice and personality and style of the current user shall use the 'user_background' background info.
If there are messages in 'recent_messages' (i.e. the array has values composed of a list of objects), you shall have the current user respond to one of those earlier messages, e.g. '@FooUser that makes sense; thank you'
The new_message shall be short, similar to messages on the historic Twitter platform.
