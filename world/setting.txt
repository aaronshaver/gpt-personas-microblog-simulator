In 2050, Mars houses a self-sustaining colony of ~5000 settlers. Recent Earth
communications blackout, a result of escalating US-China tensions, has left them
isolated. Vital supplies deplete rapidly, leading to stringent rationing.

The colony's central hub is a maze of activity, but the surrounding areas host
rival factions. Tensions mount, both within the protective colony walls and in
the wilder outposts beyond.
